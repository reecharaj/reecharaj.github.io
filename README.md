### Key Projects 
#### 1. Regression Modeling
This first example explores the bike-sharing industry which continues to thrive, reaching a global market value of around $2.8 billion in 2023. This project seeks to support Cook County Planning and Development Department in the Chicago metropolitan area in exploring the use of machine learning model that not only predicts daily bike rental numbers but also sheds light on what influences these figuresâ€”think factors like convenience, sustainability, and the health benefits of cycling. This project taps into the pulse of urban mobility trends and supports sustainable transport solutions.

#### 2. Classification Modeling
Thailand is a country with a vibrant and unique social media landscape. One of my projects entailed diving into a study titled "Usage and Engagement Patterns for Facebook Live Sellers in Thailand," which offers valuable insights into the local digital market dynamics.

This involved analyzing the impact of photo content on social media engagement. Traditionally, it is believed that photos are the most engaging type of content on social media platforms, advising clients to prioritize their use. My task during this project was to scrutinize this assumption by assessing the effectiveness of photo content in captivating audiences and driving interaction, thereby ensuring our advice to clients remains grounded in solid, up-to-date data analysis. 

This work is pivotal in refining social media strategy. Check out how I approached this analysis in my portfolio for a deeper understanding of the power of visual content in digital marketing.

#### 3. Passion Project: The Art of Mahabharata 
For my final project on this portfolio is one of the very first projects I built - A text adventure game based on combination of the Mahabharata and The Art of War.
